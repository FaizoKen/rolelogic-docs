# SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION

## What is RoleLogic?

RoleLogic is a Discord bot that automatically manages roles for your server members. You create simple rules, and RoleLogic handles role assignments 24/7.

### How It Works

RoleLogic uses IF-THEN rules to automate role changes:
- IF a member has certain roles...
- THEN automatically add or remove other roles

Example: "If someone has the Server Booster role, give them VIP."

That's it. No coding, no complex setup—just simple rules that run automatically.

### Key Features

|---------|-------------|
| Visual Rule Builder | Create rules by clicking—no coding needed |
| Real-Time Processing | Role changes happen within seconds |
| Testing Sandbox | Test rules safely before going live |
| Cross-Server Support | Manage roles across multiple servers (up to 5 linked) |
| Activity Logging | Track all configuration changes with full audit trail |
| Webhook Notifications | Get notified when roles change |
| Multi-Language | 7 languages: English, Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Malay, Portuguese (Brazilian) |

### Free Plan Includes

- 2 rules per server — enough for most basic setups

# SECTION 2: QUICK START GUIDE

## Setup in 5 Minutes

### Before You Start

You'll need:
- Administrator permission on your Discord server (or "Manage Roles" at minimum)
- A web browser

### Step 1: Invite RoleLogic

1. Visit the RoleLogic website
2. Click "Get Started Free" or "Add to Discord"
3. Select your server from the dropdown
4. Click "Authorize"

RoleLogic only needs the "Manage Roles" permission. It cannot read messages or access any private information.

### Step 2: Open the Dashboard

1. Go to the RoleLogic Dashboard
2. Click "Login with Discord"
3. Find your server and click "Manage Server"

Don't see your server? Make sure you have Administrator permission and RoleLogic is invited.

### Step 3: Position the Bot's Role

This is important! Discord only lets bots manage roles below their own position.

1. In Discord, go to Server Settings → Roles
2. Find the "RoleLogic" role
3. Drag it above all roles you want RoleLogic to manage
4. Save

Example position:
```
Admin
Moderator
RoleLogic ← Put it here
VIP
Member
Unverified
```

### Step 4: Create Your First Rule

Let's create a simple rule: remove "Unverified" when someone gets "Member".

1. In the dashboard, click "Add New Rule"
2. Set the Condition (IF): Select "Has Some Roles" → Choose "Member"
3. Set the Action (THEN): Select "Remove Roles" → Choose "Unverified"
4. Click "Save Changes"

Your rule activates within 1 hour. Want it immediately? Click the Play button to activate right away.

### Step 5: Test Your Rule

Before relying on it, test in the sandbox:
1. Click the "Test" tab
2. Select roles to simulate (e.g., Member + Unverified)
3. Click "Run Test"
4. See what would happen

# SECTION 3: CORE CONCEPTS

## Rules

A rule is an automated instruction that tells RoleLogic what to do when certain conditions are met.

### Parts of a Rule

1. **Condition (IF)**: Defines which members the rule applies to
   - Condition type: How to check roles (has some, has all, lacks some, etc.)
   - Roles to check: Which roles to look for
   - Threshold: For counting conditions (at least 3, exactly 2, etc.)

2. **Action (THEN)**: Defines what happens when conditions are met
   - Add roles: Give members one or more roles
   - Remove roles: Take away one or more roles

3. **Priority**: Determines the order rules run (0 runs first, then 1, then 2...)

4. **Status**: Rules can be Enabled, Disabled, Pending, or Stopped

### Rule Processing

Rules evaluate when:
- A member joins or leaves
- You or a moderator changes roles
- Another bot changes roles
- Discord changes roles (boosters)
- RoleLogic's own rules make changes

Processing Flow:
1. Event occurs (role change, member join, etc.)
2. RoleLogic checks all enabled rules in priority order
3. Matching rules execute their actions
4. Cascade check: If changes were made, rules are checked again
5. Repeat until no more rules match (max 100 passes)

### Cascading

One rule's action can trigger another rule:
1. Member gets "Level 10"
2. Rule A fires: "If Level 10 → add Premium"
3. Rule B fires: "If Premium → add VIP-Access"
4. No more rules match—done

Background Sync: RoleLogic runs a continuous background scan every 10 minutes to catch any missed changes. For larger servers, sync processes up to 1,000 members per interval.

## Condition Types

Conditions are the "IF" part of your rules. They determine which members a rule applies to.

### Quick Reference

| Condition | Matches When |
|-----------|--------------|
| Has Some Roles | Member has ANY of the roles |
| Has All Roles | Member has EVERY role |
| Lacks Some Roles | Member is missing ANY role |
| Lacks All Roles | Member has NONE of the roles |
| Exactly N | Member has exactly N roles |
| At Least N | Member has N or more roles |
| At Most N | Member has N or fewer roles |
| More Than N | Member has more than N roles |
| Less Than N | Member has fewer than N roles |

### Role Presence Conditions

**Has Some Roles**: Matches if member has at least one of the specified roles.
Example: IF has some of [Booster, Premium, VIP] → add Exclusive-Access
Fires if member has Booster OR Premium OR VIP.

**Has All Roles**: Matches if member has every specified role.
Example: IF has all of [Verified, Level 10, Active] → add Trusted
Only fires if member has ALL THREE roles.

**Lacks Some Roles**: Matches if member is missing at least one role.
Example: IF lacks some of [Verified, Rules-Accepted] → add Needs-Setup
Fires if member is missing Verified OR Rules-Accepted.

**Lacks All Roles**: Matches if member has none of the specified roles.
Example: IF lacks all of [Bronze, Silver, Gold] → add No-Tier
Only fires if member has NONE of the tier roles.

### Threshold Conditions

**Exactly N Roles**: Member has precisely N of the specified roles.
**At Least N Roles**: Member has N or more of the specified roles.
**At Most N Roles**: Member has N or fewer of the specified roles.
**More Than N Roles**: Member has more than N of the specified roles.
**Less Than N Roles**: Member has fewer than N of the specified roles.

### Combining Conditions (AND)

Add up to 9 additional conditions with AND logic. All must be true.
Example: IF has some of [Verified] AND has at least 2 of [Event-1, Event-2, Event-3, Event-4] AND lacks all of [Banned, Muted] → THEN add Event-Regular

---

## Actions (Add & Remove Roles)

Actions are the "THEN" part of your rules. They define what happens when a condition matches.

### Add Roles

Give members one or more roles.
Example: IF has "Server Booster" → add "VIP", "Booster Perks"

Behavior:
- Roles the member already has = no change
- Roles they don't have = added

### Remove Roles

Take away one or more roles.
Example: IF has "Verified" → remove "Unverified", "New Member"

Behavior:
- Roles the member has = removed
- Roles they don't have = no change

### Combining Actions

Click "Add Combined Action" to add AND remove in one rule.
Example: IF has "Promoted" → add "Staff" AND remove "Trainee", "Helper"

### Action Behavior

- **Idempotent**: Running the same action multiple times has the same result
- **Real-time**: Changes happen within seconds of the condition matching
- **Cascading**: Actions can trigger other rules

---

## Role Hierarchy

Discord has security rules about which roles can manage others.

### The Basic Rule

A bot can only manage roles that are BELOW its own role in the server's role list. This is a Discord security feature, not a RoleLogic limitation.

Example:
```
Admin          ← Cannot manage
Moderator      ← Cannot manage
RoleLogic      ← Bot's position
VIP            ← CAN manage
Member         ← CAN manage
Unverified     ← CAN manage
@everyone      ← CAN manage
```

### Setting Up RoleLogic's Position

1. In Discord, go to Server Settings → Roles
2. Find the "RoleLogic" role
3. Drag it above all roles you want it to manage
4. Save

### The Manage Roles Permission

RoleLogic also needs the "Manage Roles" permission (requested during invite).

To verify:
1. Go to Server Settings → Roles
2. Click the RoleLogic role
3. Check that "Manage Roles" is enabled

---

# SECTION 4: FEATURES

## Visual Rule Builder

The Rule Builder is RoleLogic's main interface for creating automation rules. No coding required—just point and click.

| Disabled | Gray | Saved but not running |
| Pending | Yellow | Queued, waiting for sync |
| Stopped | Red | Auto-stopped due to conflicts |

---

## Testing Sandbox

The Testing Sandbox lets you simulate rule execution before affecting real members.

### How to Test

1. Select roles to simulate a member having
2. Click "Run Test" to simulate
3. Review results: roles added, roles removed, rules triggered

## Cross-Server Actions

RoleLogic can manage roles across multiple Discord servers.

### What Are Cross-Server Actions?

Normally, rules work within one server. Cross-server actions let you:
- Check roles in Server A
- Add/remove roles in Server B

### Requirements

1. RoleLogic in all servers — Bot must be present with "Manage Roles" permission
2. Proper hierarchy in each server — Bot's role above managed roles
3. Member in both servers — Actions only work for members in both

### Use Cases

- Server Networks: VIP in Main Server → VIP-Access in Lounge Server
- Partner Programs: Partner in Server A → Partner-Badge in Servers B, C, D
- Organization Sync: Team-Lead in HR Server → Leadership-Access in department servers

### Limitations

- Member must be in both servers (actions silently skip otherwise)
- Cross-server uses role slots from quota
- Bot may have different hierarchy positions in each server
- Be careful to avoid loops with bidirectional setups

---

## Activity Log

A record of all changes made to your RoleLogic configuration. Shows who created, modified, or deleted rules, webhooks, and settings.

### What It Tracks

- Rule creation, updates, deletions
- Webhook/log configuration changes
- Server settings modifications
- Quota changes

**Note:** This tracks *configuration* changes, not role changes to members (that's Webhook Logs).

### Action Types

| Action | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Create | New item added |
| Update | Existing item modified |
| Delete | Item removed |
| Pause | Rule temporarily stopped |
| Start | Rule enabled/resumed |
| Stop | Rule disabled |

### Activity Log Channel

Send configuration changes to a Discord channel:
1. Go to server settings in dashboard
2. Find Activity Log Channel
3. Select a channel
4. Enable

Now configuration changes post to Discord automatically. Best practice: Use a staff-only channel.

### Filtering

Filter by:
- Action type: Only creates, only updates, etc.
- Entity type: Only rules, only logs, etc.
- Combined: "Update" + "Rule" = all rule modifications

# SECTION 8: BEST PRACTICES

## Planning Your Setup

1. Start With Goals, Not Rules: Define what you want to achieve before creating rules
2. Map Your Role Structure: Sketch your role hierarchy before automating
3. Consider All Paths: Think about how members move through your roles

## Writing Effective Rules

1. One Purpose Per Rule: Each rule should do one logical thing
2. Use Descriptive Names: "Remove Unverified when member gets Verified" not "Rule 1"
3. Keep Conditions Simple: Use complexity only when the situation requires it

## Managing Priority

1. Use Priority Intentionally:
   - Foundation rules first (Priority 0-2): Verification, basic access
   - Feature rules middle (Priority 3-6): Tiers, rewards, perks
   - Cleanup rules last (Priority 7-10): Removing old roles

2. Leave Gaps: Don't use consecutive priorities (0, 1, 2, 3...). Leave gaps for future rules.

## Testing Strategies

1. Always test in sandbox before enabling
2. Test edge cases (no roles, all roles, conflicting roles)
3. Test rule interactions
4. Verify after major changes

## Security Best Practices

1. Protect Staff Roles: Position RoleLogic's role below admin/owner roles
2. Review Rule Changes: Use Activity Log to audit changes
3. Be Careful With Remove Actions: Double-check targeting

## Quota Management

1. Consolidate rules where possible (use "Has Some" with multiple roles instead of multiple rules)
2. Delete obsolete rules promptly
3. Upgrade when consistently hitting limits

# SECTION 9: FAQ

## Getting Started

**Q: What is RoleLogic?**
A: RoleLogic is a Discord bot that automatically manages roles. You create IF-THEN rules like "If member has Booster → add VIP," and RoleLogic handles it 24/7.

**Q: Is RoleLogic free?**
A: Yes. The free plan includes 2 rules per server, all features, and 5 cross-server links. Premium plans start at $2/month for more rules.

**Q: What permissions does RoleLogic need?**
A: Only "Manage Roles". RoleLogic cannot read messages, access DMs, or see any private information.

**Q: Is my data safe?**
A: Yes. We only store Discord IDs and rule configurations. We don't store messages, passwords, or personal information.

## Rules & Features

**Q: How many rules can I create?**
A: Free: 2 rules per server. Premium: Up to 210 rules ($2-$14/month).

**Q: Can rules trigger other rules?**
A: Yes, this is called cascading. RoleLogic limits this to 100 passes to prevent infinite loops.

**Q: Can I add AND remove roles in the same rule?**
A: Yes. Use "Add Combined Action" to add some roles AND remove others in one rule.

**Q: How quickly do changes happen?**
A: Real-time: Rules trigger immediately when roles change. Background sync: Every 10 minutes.

## Troubleshooting

**Q: My rule isn't working. What should I check?**
A: Check in order:
1. Is the rule enabled?
2. Is the role hierarchy correct? (RoleLogic's role must be ABOVE roles it manages)
3. Does the condition match? (Test in sandbox)
4. Does RoleLogic have "Manage Roles" permission?
5. Is there a conflict? (Another bot or moderator reverting changes)

**Q: "Cannot manage this role" error?**
A: The role is above RoleLogic in the hierarchy. Go to Discord Server Settings → Roles, drag RoleLogic above roles you want to manage.

**Q: My rule keeps getting stopped?**
A: RoleLogic stops rules when it detects conflicts (100+ reverted actions per hour). Identify the conflict (another bot, manual changes, conflicting rules), fix it, then re-enable.

**Q: Changes keep reverting?**
A: Another system is undoing RoleLogic's changes. Check: other bots, moderators, Discord integrations, or your own conflicting rules.

## Cross-Server

**Q: Can RoleLogic manage roles across servers?**
A: Yes. Requirements: RoleLogic in both servers, member in both servers, correct hierarchy in target server.

**Q: Cross-server action not working?**
A: Check: RoleLogic in BOTH servers, member in BOTH servers, role hierarchy correct in TARGET server, "Manage Roles" permission in both.

## Premium & Billing

**Q: How do I upgrade?**
A: Dashboard → Upgrade → Choose tier → Subscribe through Patreon → Quota syncs within 5 minutes.

**Q: What happens if I downgrade?**
A: Rules are deactivated, not deleted. Most recent rules stay active within your new quota. Upgrade again and deactivated rules reactivate.

**Q: Can I share premium across servers?**
A: Yes. Assign your quota across multiple servers as needed.

**Q: Is there a free trial?**
A: The free plan (2 rules) serves as your trial. No time limit.

# SECTION 12: ROLE LINK API REFERENCE (EXTERNAL)

The Role Link external API lets external applications manage users linked to a Discord role programmatically via HTTP. Use it to grant Discord roles after purchases, sync membership from external databases, automate verification, or integrate with third-party platforms.

## Base URL

https://apirolelogic.faizo.net

## Authentication

Every request requires an `Authorization` header using the `Token` scheme (NOT `Bearer`):

```
Authorization: Token rl_your_token_here
```

Tokens start with `rl_` prefix. Each token is scoped to one role link (one guild + one role pair). Generate tokens from the RoleLogic Dashboard under Role Links > Reset Token. Tokens are shown only once; resetting generates a new token and immediately invalidates the old one.

## Endpoints

### GET /api/role-link/:guildId/:roleId/users
List all user IDs linked to this role.

Response:
```json
{ "data": ["123456789012345678", "234567890123456789"] }
```

### PUT /api/role-link/:guildId/:roleId/users
Atomically replace the entire user list. Request body is a JSON array of Discord user ID strings.

Request body:
```json
["123456789012345678", "234567890123456789"]
```

Response:
```json
{ "data": { "user_count": 2 } }
```

- Duplicates are deduplicated automatically.
- Empty array `[]` removes all users.
- 2-minute timeout for large payloads.

### GET /api/role-link/:guildId/:roleId/users/:userId
Check if a specific user exists in the list.

Response:
```json
{ "data": { "exists": true } }
```

### POST /api/role-link/:guildId/:roleId/users/:userId
Add a single user. Idempotent: returns `added: false` if user already exists.

Response:
```json
{ "data": { "added": true } }
```

### DELETE /api/role-link/:guildId/:roleId/users/:userId
Remove a single user. Idempotent: returns `removed: false` if user was not in list.

Response:
```json
{ "data": { "removed": true } }
```

## Path Parameters

- `guildId`: Discord server (guild) ID (numeric snowflake)
- `roleId`: Discord role ID (numeric snowflake)
- `userId`: Discord user ID (17–20 digit snowflake)

## Limits

| Resource | Free Plan | Premium |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Users per role link | 100 | 1,000,000 |
| Role links per server | 10 | 10 |

## Error Responses

| Status | Message | Cause |
|--------|---------|-------|
| 401 | Authorization header required | Missing Authorization header |
| 401 | Invalid authorization scheme | Used Bearer instead of Token |
| 403 | Invalid or revoked token | Token mismatch or was reset |
| 403 | This role link is disabled | Role link disabled in dashboard |
| 400 | Maximum N users per role link | User limit exceeded |
| 400 | Validation error | Invalid request body format |
| 404 | Role link not found | No role link for this guild/role |

## Role Link API FAQ

Q: Can one token access multiple role links?
A: No. Each token is scoped to exactly one guild + role pair.

Q: Are endpoints idempotent?
A: Yes. Add returns added:false if exists. Remove returns removed:false if not found. Safe to retry.

Q: Does modifying users trigger Discord role sync?
A: Yes. The bot is notified automatically and syncs within seconds.

Q: What format are user IDs?
A: Discord snowflake format: 17–20 digit numeric strings.
