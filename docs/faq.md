## Getting Started

### What is RoleLogic?

RoleLogic is a Discord bot that automatically manages roles. You create IF-THEN rules like "If member has Booster → add VIP," and RoleLogic handles it 24/7.

### Is RoleLogic free?

Yes. The free plan includes:

- 2 rules per server
- 2 integrations per server
- All 9 condition types, add/remove actions, sandbox testing, and activity logs
- Cross-server sync to 2 distinct destination servers (Premium expands this to 10)

Need more rules? See [Plans & Pricing](./plans).

### What permissions does RoleLogic need?

For role automation, RoleLogic needs **Manage Roles**, and its server role must sit above every role it will add or remove. It cannot read messages or access DMs. If you configure webhook logs, it additionally needs **Manage Webhooks** in the target channel.

### Is my data safe?

RoleLogic stores Discord identifiers, rule and integration configuration, and
the minimum account data needed for services you choose to connect. Integrations
that require OAuth may store encrypted access or refresh tokens. RoleLogic does
not read message or DM content, store your passwords, or receive payment-card
details. See the [Privacy Policy](https://rolelogic.faizo.net/privacy) for the
current details.

## Rules & Features

### How many rules can I create?

- **Free:** 2 rules per server
- **Premium:** Paid quota is added to the 2 base slots, for plan totals from 12 to 210 rules per server

See [Plans & Pricing](./plans) for tier details.

### Can rules trigger other rules?

Yes, this is called **cascading**. Example:

- Rule A: If has Gold → add Silver
- Rule B: If has Silver → add Bronze

When someone gets Gold, both rules fire automatically. RoleLogic limits this to 100 passes to prevent infinite loops.

### What condition types are available?

| Condition        | Matches When                           |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Has Some Roles   | Member has ANY selected role           |
| Has All Roles    | Member has EVERY selected role         |
| Lacks Some Roles | Member is missing ANY selected role    |
| Lacks All Roles  | Member has NONE of the selected roles  |
| Exactly N        | Member has exactly N selected roles    |
| At Least N       | Member has N or more selected roles    |
| At Most N        | Member has N or fewer selected roles   |
| More Than N      | Member has more than N selected roles  |
| Less Than N      | Member has fewer than N selected roles |

### Can I add AND remove roles in the same rule?

Yes. Use "Add Combined Action" to add some roles AND remove others in one rule.

### How quickly do changes happen?

- **Event-driven:** A role change starts evaluation automatically.
- **Debounce:** Bursty changes are grouped for about 10 seconds on Free and 1.5 seconds on Premium.
- **Background sync:** A safety sweep catches anything missed in real time — about every 30 minutes on Free and every 2 minutes on Premium. Premium also scans more members per cycle.

## Troubleshooting

### My rule isn't working

For the full symptom-by-symptom workflow, see [Discord role bot troubleshooting](./guides/troubleshoot-discord-role-bot).

Check these in order:

1. **Is the rule enabled?** Check the toggle in the dashboard
2. **Is the role hierarchy correct?** RoleLogic's role must be ABOVE roles it manages
3. **Does the condition match?** Test in the sandbox with exact roles
4. **Does RoleLogic have permissions?** Verify "Manage Roles" is granted
5. **Is there a conflict?** Another bot or moderator might be reverting changes

### "Cannot manage this role"

The role is above RoleLogic in the hierarchy.

**Fix:**

1. Go to Discord Server Settings → Roles
2. Find the "RoleLogic" role
3. Drag it ABOVE roles you want to manage
4. Save

### My rule keeps getting stopped

RoleLogic stops rules when it detects conflicts (100+ reverted actions per hour).

**Common causes:**

- Another bot fighting over the same role
- A moderator manually reverting changes
- Two of your rules conflicting

**Fix:** Identify the conflict, resolve it, then re-enable the rule.

### Rule works for some members but not others

**Possible causes:**

- Role hierarchy only allows some roles to be managed
- Cross-server rule: member isn't in both servers
- Unusual role combination causes different condition to match

**Fix:** Test in sandbox with the exact role combination.

### Changes keep reverting

Another system is undoing RoleLogic's changes.

**Check:**

- Other bots managing the same roles
- Moderators manually changing roles
- Discord integrations affecting roles
- Your own rules conflicting

### Webhook notifications not appearing

Check in order:

1. RoleLogic needs **"Manage Webhooks"** permission in the channel
2. Webhook must be attached to an enabled rule
3. Rule must actually be triggering

### Can't see my server in the dashboard

- Verify you have Administrator or Manage Roles permission
- Make sure RoleLogic is invited to the server
- Try logging out and back in

### Changes are delayed

Normal delays:

- Role-change debounce: about 10 seconds on Free or 1.5 seconds on Premium
- New rule activation: up to 1 hour for full propagation

For longer delays, check [Discord status](https://status.discord.com).

---

## Cross-Server

### Can RoleLogic manage roles across servers?

Yes. Create rules that affect roles in other servers where RoleLogic is present.

**Example:** When someone gets "VIP" in Main Server, add "VIP Access" in Lounge Server.

### Cross-server action not working

**Requirements:**

- RoleLogic must be in BOTH servers
- Member must be in BOTH servers
- Role hierarchy must be correct in the TARGET server
- "Manage Roles" permission needed in both servers

### How many other servers can a server sync to?

The cross-server sync limit counts distinct destination servers, not rules:

- **Free:** 2 destination servers per server
- **Premium (any tier):** 10 destination servers per server

If saving a rule would push you over the limit, the dashboard rejects the save and tells you the cap.

### What happens to my cross-server rules if I downgrade?

Nothing is deleted. RoleLogic keeps the highest-priority rules that fit your new free limit (2 distinct destination servers) and pauses the rest with a yellow "rule paused" banner in the editor. Re-subscribing reactivates them; editing or deleting also works.

## Premium & Billing

### How do I upgrade?

1. Open **Upgrade** in your dashboard
2. Choose a plan (monthly or annual — annual saves the most)
3. Subscribe securely through Stripe
4. Quota activates automatically right after checkout

### What happens if I downgrade?

Rules are **deactivated, not deleted**. Most recent rules stay active within your new quota. Cross-server rules that target more than 2 distinct other servers are also paused until you fit the free limit. If you upgrade again, deactivated rules reactivate automatically.

### Can I move quota between servers?

Yes, but there's a 7-day cooldown after assigning quota to prevent abuse.

### Does premium include anything besides more rules?

Yes — besides faster sync, watermark-free notifications, and expanded limits, every plan from Tier 2 ($5/mo) also unlocks premium in **[DWEEB](https://dweeb.faizo.net)**, the visual Discord webhook message builder by the same developer: Tier 2–3 include DWEEB Plus, Tier 4–5 include DWEEB Pro, applied to one server of your choice at no extra cost. See [Plans & Pricing](./plans#dweeb-premium-included).

### How do I cancel?

Open **Upgrade → Manage subscription** to cancel through the Stripe billing portal anytime. Features remain active until the billing period ends. (Existing Patreon supporters cancel through Patreon.)

### Refunds?

Contact support for a refund. Stripe payments can be refunded directly; legacy Patreon subscriptions are refunded through Patreon.

---

## Other Bots

### Does RoleLogic work with other bots?

Yes. When other bots (MEE6, Carl-bot, etc.) change roles, RoleLogic evaluates if your rules apply.

**Warning:** Avoid bots managing the same roles. They can conflict.

### What happens during Discord outages?

Changes may be delayed. The periodic background sweep rechecks members after normal processing resumes.

---

## Privacy & Security

### What data does RoleLogic store?

**Stored:**

- Discord user, server, and role IDs
- Rule and integration configurations
- Activity logs
- The minimum status or account data needed for integrations you connect
- Encrypted OAuth or API tokens when an integration needs continued access

**NOT stored:**

- Messages or channel content
- DMs or passwords
- Payment-card details (handled by Stripe)

### How do I delete my data?

- Remove RoleLogic from your server to stop role processing
- Unlink connected integrations to revoke their access where supported
- Contact support to request deletion of stored RoleLogic data; limited records may be retained when required for security, fraud prevention, or legal compliance
- Revoke dashboard access in Discord settings to end the Discord authorization

### Is RoleLogic secure?

RoleLogic limits access and protects sensitive integration credentials with:

- Encryption at rest for stored integration and API tokens
- Scoped OAuth flows for Discord and connected services
- A minimal Discord permission model centered on Manage Roles
