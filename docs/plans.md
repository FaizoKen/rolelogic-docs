## Free Plan

The free plan includes everything you need to get started:

- **2 rules per server** — enough for verification cleanup + booster rewards
- **All 9 condition types** — full access to every matching option
- **All action types** — add and remove roles freely
- **Testing sandbox** — test rules before going live
- **Activity log** — track all configuration changes
- **5 cross-server links** — connect multiple servers

**Perfect for:**

- Small servers testing RoleLogic
- Basic verification systems
- Simple booster rewards
- Servers with 1-2 automation needs

**Example free plan setup:**

1. Rule 1: "If has Verified → remove Unverified"

That's a complete verification + booster system with just 2 rules.

## How to Upgrade

1. Open the **Upgrade** section in your RoleLogic dashboard
2. Choose a tier that fits your needs
3. Complete subscription through Patreon
4. Your quota syncs automatically within 5 minutes
5. Assign quota to your server(s)

## Managing Premium

### Changing Tiers

Upgrade or downgrade anytime through Patreon. Changes sync within 5 minutes.

### Canceling

Cancel through Patreon anytime. Premium features remain active until the billing period ends.

### Refunds

Refunds are available within 7 days per Patreon's terms.

## Quota System

### How Quota Works

Premium quota is allocated per server:

- You assign your quota to specific servers
- Multiple servers can share your total quota
- Each server has its own rule limit

**Example:** With Tier 2 (38 total rules), you could:

- Give one server all 38 rules, OR
- Split: 20 rules on Server A, 18 on Server B

### Quota Cooldown

After assigning quota to a server, there's a **7-day cooldown** before you can reassign it elsewhere. This ensures service stability.

### Checking Your Quota

In the dashboard, you'll see:

- **Rules used:** "Rules: 5 / 38"
- **Quota allocation:** Which servers have what

## What Happens When Downgrading?

When you downgrade to a lower tier or cancel:

- **Rules are deactivated, not deleted** — Your rules stay saved
- **Most recent rules stay active** — Within your new quota limit
- **Automatic reactivation on upgrade** — If you upgrade again, deactivated rules come back

**Example:** If you have 30 rules and downgrade to Tier 1 (12 rules), 18 rules are deactivated but preserved. Upgrade back, and all 30 reactivate.

## Tips for Staying Within Quota

### Consolidate Rules

**Instead of 3 rules:**

```
Rule 1: If Booster → add VIP
Rule 2: If Premium → add VIP
Rule 3: If Supporter → add VIP
```

**Use 1 rule:**

```
Rule 1: If has some of [Booster, Premium, Supporter] → add VIP
```

### Use Threshold Conditions

Replace multiple rules with "At Least N" or "Exactly N" conditions.

### Let Rules Cascade

Design rules that trigger each other for complex automation without using extra rule slots.

## FAQ
