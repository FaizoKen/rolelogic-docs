## Verification Systems

### Basic Verification Cleanup

**Goal:** When a member gets verified, remove their unverified/guest roles.

**Rule Configuration:**

- **IF**: Has Some Roles → [Verified]
- **THEN**: Remove Roles → [Unverified, Guest, New Member]

**How it works:** As soon as someone receives the "Verified" role (from you, a verification bot, or another system), RoleLogic removes all the pre-verification roles.

**Works with:** Captcha.bot, Wick, AltDentifier, manual verification, Discord's built-in verification

---

### Pending Verification

**Goal:** Give new members a "Pending" role if they don't have any verification status.

**Rule Configuration:**

- **IF**: Lacks All Roles → [Verified, Pending, Rejected]
- **THEN**: Add Roles → [Pending]

**How it works:** Members without any verification status automatically get "Pending" to indicate they need to complete verification.

:::tip
Remember that all members have @everyone. Test this rule with @everyone selected to ensure it works correctly.
:::

---

### Verification + Channel Access

**Goal:** Verified members should get access to member channels.

**Rule Configuration:**

- **IF**: Has Some Roles → [Verified]
- **THEN**: Add Roles → [Member Channels Access]

**How it works:** Verification unlocks channel access automatically.

---

### Complete 2-Step Verification

**Goal:** Require both email verification AND rules acceptance.

**Rule Configuration:**

- **IF**: Has All Roles → [Email Verified, Rules Accepted]
- **THEN**: Add Roles → [Verified, Member Access]

**How it works:** Members must complete BOTH steps before getting full access.

---

## Tier and Level Systems

### Auto-Remove Lower Tiers

**Goal:** When someone reaches a higher tier, remove their lower tier roles.

**Rule 1 (Priority 0):**

- **IF**: Has Some Roles → [Gold Tier]
- **THEN**: Remove Roles → [Bronze Tier, Silver Tier]

**Rule 2 (Priority 1):**

- **IF**: Has Some Roles → [Silver Tier]
- **THEN**: Remove Roles → [Bronze Tier]

**How it works:** Each tier removes all lower tiers, maintaining clean role assignments.

---

### Tier Benefits (Cascade Down)

**Goal:** Higher tiers should automatically receive lower tier benefits.

**Rule 1:**

- **IF**: Has Some Roles → [Platinum Tier]
- **THEN**: Add Roles → [Gold Benefits, Silver Benefits, Bronze Benefits]

**Rule 2:**

- **IF**: Has Some Roles → [Gold Tier]
- **THEN**: Add Roles → [Silver Benefits, Bronze Benefits]

**Rule 3:**

- **IF**: Has Some Roles → [Silver Tier]
- **THEN**: Add Roles → [Bronze Benefits]

**How it works:** Benefits cascade down—platinum members get all benefits.

---

### No-Tier Indicator

**Goal:** Give a "No Tier" role to members without any tier.

**Rule 1:**

- **IF**: Lacks All Roles → [Bronze Tier, Silver Tier, Gold Tier, Platinum Tier]
- **THEN**: Add Roles → [No Tier]

**Rule 2:**

- **IF**: Has Some Roles → [Bronze Tier, Silver Tier, Gold Tier, Platinum Tier]
- **THEN**: Remove Roles → [No Tier]

**How it works:** Members without any tier get tagged. Getting any tier removes the tag.

---

### MEE6/Leveling Bot Integration

**Goal:** Clean up when leveling bot assigns new level roles.

**Rule Configuration:**

- **IF**: Has Some Roles → [Level 20]
- **THEN**: Remove Roles → [Level 5, Level 10, Level 15]

**How it works:** When a leveling bot like MEE6 assigns Level 20, RoleLogic removes the old level roles automatically.

---

## VIP and Rewards

### Server Booster VIP

**Goal:** Server boosters automatically get VIP status.

**Rule Configuration:**

- **IF**: Has Some Roles → [Server Booster]
- **THEN**: Add Roles → [VIP, Booster Perks, Exclusive Access]

**How it works:** Discord's built-in booster role triggers your custom VIP roles.

---

### Multi-Qualification VIP

**Goal:** VIP requires both supporter AND active member status.

**Rule Configuration:**

- **IF**: Has All Roles → [Supporter, Active Member]
- **THEN**: Add Roles → [VIP]

**How it works:** Both conditions must be met—being a supporter alone isn't enough.

---

### Loyalty Badge (Collectors)

**Goal:** Give a special badge to members with multiple achievements.

**Rule Configuration:**

- **IF**: At Least 3 Roles → [Achievement 1, Achievement 2, Achievement 3, Achievement 4, Achievement 5]
- **THEN**: Add Roles → [Collector Badge]

**How it works:** Members who collect at least 3 achievements get recognized.

---

### Event Winner Rewards

**Goal:** Event winners get special perks across categories.

**Rule Configuration:**

- **IF**: Has Some Roles → [1st Place, 2nd Place, 3rd Place]
- **THEN**: Add Roles → [Event Winner, Winner Lounge Access]

**How it works:** Any podium finish unlocks winner benefits.

---

### Remove VIP When Booster Lapses

**Goal:** Automatically remove VIP perks when someone stops boosting.

**Rule Configuration:**

- **IF**: Lacks All Roles → [Server Booster, Patreon Supporter, Premium]
- **THEN**: Remove Roles → [VIP, Exclusive Access, Booster Perks]

**How it works:** When all VIP-granting roles are gone, VIP perks are removed.

---

## Staff Management

### Staff Promotion Cleanup

**Goal:** When promoted to full staff, remove trainee roles.

**Rule Configuration:**

- **IF**: Has Some Roles → [Moderator]
- **THEN**: Remove Roles → [Trial Moderator, Helper, Trainee]

**How it works:** Promotion to full moderator cleans up all training roles.

---

### Combined Conditions AND Actions (Advanced)

**Goal:** When a verified member reaches Level 10 AND is not muted, upgrade them to Trusted Member AND remove their Newcomer role.

**Rule Configuration:**

- **IF**: Has All Roles → [Verified, Level 10] **AND** Lacks All Roles → [Muted, Banned]
- **THEN**: Add Roles → [Trusted Member, Community Access] **AND** Remove Roles → [Newcomer, Limited Access]

**How it works:** This rule combines multiple conditions (must have Verified AND Level 10, must NOT have Muted or Banned) with multiple actions (add rewards AND remove starter roles)—all in a single rule. This is more efficient than creating separate rules and ensures all changes happen together.

:::tip Using Combined AND Logic
You can add up to 9 AND conditions and combine Add + Remove actions in one rule. This is perfect for:

- Tiered promotions with cleanup
- Complex qualification requirements
- Atomic role transitions (add new, remove old simultaneously)
  :::

---

### Staff Base Permissions

**Goal:** All staff roles should have base staff access.

**Rule Configuration:**

- **IF**: Has Some Roles → [Helper, Moderator, Admin, Owner]

**Goal:** Members can only be on one team—if they somehow have both, remove one.

**Rule Configuration:**

## Cross-Server Actions

Cross-server (cross-guild) actions let you manage roles across multiple Discord servers from a single rule. These examples require RoleLogic to be in all involved servers with proper permissions.

### VIP Sync Across Servers

**Goal:** When someone gets VIP in your main server, automatically give them VIP access in your secondary/lounge server.

**Servers:**

- **Main Server**: Where members earn VIP status
- **Lounge Server**: Exclusive VIP hangout

**Rule Configuration (created in Main Server):**

- **IF**: Has Some Roles → [VIP]
- **THEN**: Add Roles → [Lounge Access] _(select from Lounge Server)_

**How it works:** When a member receives "VIP" in the main server, RoleLogic adds "Lounge Access" from your other server—if the member is in both servers.

:::info Cross-Server Requirements

- RoleLogic must be in **both** servers with "Manage Roles" permission
- RoleLogic's role must be positioned correctly in **both** servers
- The member must exist in **both** servers for the action to apply

### Partner Network Badge

**Goal:** Partners in your main community get recognition badges in all your network servers.

**Servers:**

- **Community Hub**: Main server where partners are assigned
- **Gaming Server**: Secondary server
- **Events Server**: Tertiary server

**Rule Configuration (created in Community Hub):**

- **IF**: Has Some Roles → [Partner]
- **THEN**: Add Roles → [Partner Badge] _(from Gaming Server)_, [Partner Badge] _(from Events Server)_

**How it works:** Assigning "Partner" in your hub automatically grants partner badges across your entire server network.

---

### Verification Sync

**Goal:** Members verified in one server don't need to re-verify in linked servers.

**Rule Configuration (created in Main Server):**

- **IF**: Has All Roles → [Verified, Member]
- **THEN**: Add Roles → [Verified] _(from Partner Server)_ **AND** Remove Roles → [Unverified] _(from Partner Server)_

**How it works:** Once verified in your main server, members automatically get verified status in partner servers, skipping duplicate verification processes.

---

### Staff Sync Across Servers

**Goal:** Staff members get appropriate roles in all servers you manage.

**Rule Configuration (created in Main Server):**

- **IF**: Has Some Roles → [Moderator, Admin]
- **THEN**: Add Roles → [Staff Access] _(from Server B)_, [Staff Access] _(from Server C)_

**How it works:** Promoting someone to staff in your main server grants them staff access across all your servers automatically.

---

### Event Winner Cross-Server Rewards

**Goal:** Event winners in your events server get recognition in your main community.

**Servers:**

- **Events Server**: Where competitions happen
- **Main Community**: Where winners should be recognized

**Rule Configuration (created in Events Server):**

- **IF**: Has Some Roles → [1st Place, 2nd Place, 3rd Place]
- **THEN**: Add Roles → [Event Champion] _(from Main Community)_, [Winner Lounge] _(from Main Community)_

**How it works:** Winners in events automatically get champion status and lounge access in your main community server.

---

### Community Network Recognition

**Goal:** Members of your main/official server get special recognition and perks when they join your satellite servers (game-specific servers, regional servers, or community-run fan servers).

**Servers:**

- **Official Hub**: Your main community server
- **Game Server**: Satellite server for a specific game
- **Regional Server**: Community server for a specific region

**Rule 1: Hub Member Badge (created in Official Hub):**

- **IF**: Has Some Roles → [@everyone]
- **THEN**: Add Roles → [Hub Member] _(from Game Server)_, [Official Community] _(from Regional Server)_

**Rule 2: Established Member Perks (created in Official Hub):**

- **IF**: Has Some Roles → [Verified, Active Member]
- **THEN**: Add Roles → [Trusted Visitor] _(from Game Server)_, [Verified Crossover] _(from Regional Server)_

**Rule 3: VIP Network Access (created in Official Hub):**

- **IF**: Has Some Roles → [VIP, Server Booster, Patreon]
- **THEN**: Add Roles → [VIP Guest] _(from Game Server)_, [Premium Network Member] _(from Regional Server)_

**How it works:** Simply being a member of your official hub (@everyone) grants recognition in satellite servers. Higher status in the hub unlocks progressively better perks across your entire network. Members feel rewarded for being part of the main community wherever they go.

**Use cases:**

- **Gaming organizations** with game-specific Discord servers
- **Content creators** with main channel + game/topic-specific communities
- **Large communities** with regional or language-specific servers
- **Server networks** wanting to reward loyal hub members

**Keywords:** cross-server Discord, multi-server roles, linked servers, server network, cross-guild automation

## Tips for Implementing Scenarios

### Start Simple

Implement one scenario at a time. Test it thoroughly before adding more complexity.

### Test Every Rule

Use the sandbox to verify each rule works as expected before going live.

### Consider Rule Consolidation

With the free plan's 2-rule limit, look for ways to combine logic:

- Use "Has Some Roles" with multiple roles instead of separate rules
- Combine add AND remove actions in one rule
- Let cascading handle complex chains

### Document Your Setup

Keep notes about why you configured rules certain ways. Future you will thank present you.

### Review Regularly

As your server evolves, revisit these rules. Remove obsolete ones and update others.
