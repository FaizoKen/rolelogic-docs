# Glossary

Definitions of terms used throughout the RoleLogic documentation.

## Quick Summary

**RoleLogic Core Concepts:**

- **Rule** = IF (condition) + THEN (action) — the basic building block
- **Condition** = "IF" part — determines which members match (9 types available)
- **Action** = "THEN" part — what happens when condition matches (Add Roles, Remove Roles)
- **Cascading** = when one rule triggers another automatically
- **Priority** = execution order (lower numbers run first: 0, 1, 2...)
- **Quota** = limits on rules per server (Free: 2, Premium: up to 210)

---

## A

### Action

The "THEN" part of a rule. Actions define what happens when a condition matches. RoleLogic supports two action types: **Add Roles** and **Remove Roles**.

### Activity Log

A record of all changes made to your RoleLogic configuration. Shows who created, modified, or deleted rules, webhooks, and settings.

### AND Condition

An additional condition added to a rule using "Add AND Condition." All AND conditions must be true (along with the primary condition) for the rule to trigger.

---

## B

### Bot

A Discord application that can perform automated actions. RoleLogic is a bot that manages roles automatically.

---

## C

### Cascading

When one rule's action triggers another rule. For example, Rule A adds "VIP" which causes Rule B (if has VIP, add Lounge Access) to fire. RoleLogic handles cascading automatically.

### Condition

The "IF" part of a rule. Conditions define which members a rule applies to based on their current roles.

### Cross-Server Action

An action that affects roles in a different Discord server than where the rule is configured. Requires RoleLogic to be present in both servers.

---

## D

### Dashboard

The web interface where you manage RoleLogic. Access it by logging in with Discord to create rules, view logs, and configure settings.

### Disabled (Rule Status)

A rule that is saved but not running. Disabled rules don't process any members until re-enabled.

---

## E

### Enabled (Rule Status)

A rule that is active and processing members. Enabled rules evaluate whenever member roles change.

---

## F

### Free Plan

RoleLogic's base tier that includes 2 rules per server, all 9 condition types, all action types, testing sandbox, activity log, and 5 cross-server links. No time limit or credit card required.

---

## G

### Guild

Discord's technical term for a "server." In RoleLogic, "guild" and "server" are used interchangeably.

---

## I

### IF-THEN Rule

The fundamental structure of RoleLogic automation. "IF" defines the condition (which members match), and "THEN" defines the action (what happens). Example: IF member has "Server Booster" THEN add "VIP" role.

---

## L

### Linked Guild

A server that has cross-server relationship with another server through RoleLogic rules. Rules in Server A can affect roles in Linked Guild B.

---

## M

### Manage Roles Permission

The Discord permission RoleLogic needs to add and remove roles from members. Without this permission, RoleLogic cannot function.

### Match

When a rule's condition evaluates to true for a member. A matching rule executes its action.

---

## P

### Placeholder

A variable in webhook messages that gets replaced with actual data when sent. Example: `{user.mention}` becomes `@JohnDoe`.

### Premium

Paid subscription plans that expand quotas and unlock additional features like watermark removal.

### Priority

A number that determines the order rules execute. Lower numbers run first (0 before 1 before 2, etc.).

### Purge

To remove all cross-server actions targeting a specific linked guild. Used to disconnect servers from cross-server relationships.

---

## Q

### Quota

Limits on how many rules and resources you can use. Free plans have base quotas; premium plans provide additional quota.

---

## R

### Real-Time Processing

RoleLogic's ability to evaluate and execute rules immediately when member roles change, typically within seconds. Complemented by a background sync every 10 minutes to catch any missed changes.

### Role

A Discord role that can be assigned to members. Roles grant permissions and can be used to organize members.

### Role Hierarchy

Discord's system where roles are ranked from highest to lowest. Bots can only manage roles below their own position. RoleLogic can only manage roles positioned below its own role.

### Rule

A complete automation instruction combining a condition (IF) and action (THEN). Rules run continuously to manage member roles.

---

## S

### Sandbox

The testing environment where you can simulate rule execution without affecting real members. Also called "Testing Sandbox."

### Server

A Discord community space. Also called a "guild" in Discord's terminology.

### Stopped (Rule Status)

A rule that was automatically disabled by RoleLogic's safety systems, usually due to detected conflicts.

---

## T

### Testing Sandbox

See "Sandbox."

### Threshold

A number used in count-based conditions. Example: "At Least 3" uses 3 as the threshold.

### Trigger

When a condition matches and causes a rule's action to execute. "The rule was triggered."

---

## W

### Watermark

Branding included in webhook messages on the free plan. Premium plans remove the watermark.

### Webhook

A Discord feature that allows external services to post messages to channels. RoleLogic uses webhooks for notifications about role changes.

### Webhook Log

A configured notification that sends messages to a Discord channel when rules trigger. Customizable with placeholders.

---

## V

### Visual Rule Builder

RoleLogic's graphical interface for creating rules. Users select conditions and actions by clicking rather than writing code. Accessible through the web dashboard after logging in with Discord.
