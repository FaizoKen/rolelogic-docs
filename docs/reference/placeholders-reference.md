# Placeholders Reference

Placeholders allow you to include dynamic information in webhook messages. When a notification is sent, placeholders are replaced with actual values.

## How to Use Placeholders

Type placeholders in curly braces within your message content:

```
Hello, {user.mention}! You received: {roles.added.names}
```

**Output:**

```
Hello, @JohnDoe! You received: VIP, Premium
```

### Tips

- Placeholders are case-sensitive
- Invalid placeholders appear as-is (not replaced)
- Use the placeholder dropdown in the editor for suggestions

## Time and Date Placeholders

| --------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `{time:short}`  | Short time format                       | 3:45 PM          |

```
Changed: {timestamp}
```

**Relative time:**

```

### About Discord Timestamps

Discord timestamps (like `{timestamp}` and `{timestamp:r}`) are special. They render differently for each user based on their timezone and Discord settings. This is usually the best choice for logging.

| Format   | Code            | Result                   |
| -------- | --------------- | ------------------------ |
| Default  | `{timestamp}`   | January 15, 2024 3:45 PM |
| Relative | `{timestamp:r}` | 5 minutes ago            |

## Placeholder Suggestions

When typing in the webhook message editor:

1. Type `{` to open the suggestion dropdown
2. Continue typing to filter suggestions
3. Click a suggestion to insert it
4. Suggestions are organized by category

If you see "No matching placeholders," check your spelling.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Placeholder Not Replaced

If you see the raw placeholder (e.g., `{user.mention}`) in your output:

- Check spelling and capitalization
- Ensure curly braces are correct
- Try removing and re-typing the placeholder

### Empty Value

Some placeholders may be empty in certain situations:

- `{roles.added.names}` is empty if no roles were added
- `{server.description}` is empty if no description is set
- Design your messages to handle empty values gracefully

### Unexpected Format

Date and time formats may vary based on system settings. Discord timestamps (`{timestamp}`) are the most reliable for consistent display.
