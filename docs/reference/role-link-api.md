# Role Link API Reference

This reference covers everything you need to build a **Role Link plugin** for RoleLogic. A plugin is an external server that integrates with RoleLogic to control which Discord users receive a specific role — based on your own logic (purchases, verification, subscriptions, game stats, etc.).

## How It Works

A Role Link connects a **Discord role** to your **plugin server**. The flow is:

1. A server admin creates a Role Link in the RoleLogic Dashboard, providing your plugin's HTTPS URL.
2. RoleLogic calls your plugin's **register endpoint** to notify it that a role link was created, sending the `guild_id`, `role_id`, and the API token. If your plugin rejects the registration, the role link is not created.
3. RoleLogic calls your plugin's **config endpoint** (`GET /config`) to fetch a configuration form.
4. The admin fills out the form in the dashboard; RoleLogic validates it and sends it to your plugin's **config endpoint**.
5. Your plugin uses the **User Management API** (token-authenticated REST API) to add or remove users from the role link.
6. RoleLogic's bot syncs the user list to Discord role assignments automatically.

As a plugin developer, you need to implement **two things**:

- A **plugin server** that serves a configuration schema and accepts config submissions.
- Logic that calls the **User Management API** to manage which users have the role.

## Plugin Server Contract

Your plugin server must expose endpoints under the **plugin URL** that the admin provides when creating a Role Link. RoleLogic appends paths to this base URL:

| Method   | Path        | Purpose                          | Called when                     |
| -------- | ----------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `GET`    | `/health`   | Report plugin health status      | Status page polls plugin health |
| `POST`   | `/register` | Acknowledge role link creation   | Admin creates a role link       |
| `GET`    | `/config`   | Return configuration form schema | Dashboard loads the role link   |
| `POST`   | `/config`   | Receive submitted configuration  | Admin saves config in dashboard |
| `DELETE` | `/config`   | Clean up on role link deletion   | Admin deletes the role link     |

### Plugin URL Requirements

- Must use **HTTPS** — HTTP URLs are rejected.
- Must not point to private/internal addresses: `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`, `0.0.0.0`, `10.*`, `192.168.*`, `172.16-31.*`, `*.internal`, `*.local`.
- Trailing slashes are automatically stripped (e.g., `https://example.com/` becomes `https://example.com`).
- Maximum length: **500 characters**.

### How RoleLogic Authenticates to Your Plugin

RoleLogic includes the role link's API token in requests to your server:

```http
Authorization: Token rl_...
User-Agent: RoleLogic/1.0
```

You can use this token to identify which role link the request belongs to. The same token is used for the User Management API, so you can verify it matches by calling the API with it.

---

### GET /health

RoleLogic periodically polls `GET {plugin_url}/health` to monitor your plugin's availability. The results are displayed on the **Server Status** page (`/status`). This endpoint is **not authenticated** — no `Authorization` header is sent.

**Expected response** (HTTP 200):

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-03-25T12:00:00.000Z",
  "checks": {
    "database": {
      "status": "up",
      "latency_ms": 3
    }
  },
  "services": [
    {
      "name": "YouTube API",
      "status": "up",
      "latency_ms": 120
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| ----- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| `status` | `"healthy"` \| `"degraded"` \| `"unhealthy"` | Yes | Overall plugin status. `healthy` = all checks pass, `degraded` = some checks failing but service is up, `unhealthy` = critical failure. |
| `timestamp` | string (ISO 8601) | No | When the health check was performed. |
| `checks` | object | No | Map of named internal dependency checks. Each check has a `status` (`"up"` or `"down"`), optional `latency_ms`, and optional `message` for error details. |
| `services` | array | No | List of external service pings. Each entry has `name` (string), `status` (`"up"` or `"down"`), and optional `latency_ms`. Use this to report connectivity to third-party APIs your plugin depends on (e.g. YouTube, GitHub, game APIs). |

**Minimal response** — if your plugin has no internal dependencies to check, a simple response is fine:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy"
}
```

**Behavior when missing** — if your plugin does not implement `/health`, the status page will show it as **unreachable**. Implementing this endpoint is recommended but not required.

**Timeout** — RoleLogic waits up to **5 seconds** for a response before marking the plugin as unreachable.

---

### POST /register

When an admin creates a new Role Link, RoleLogic calls `POST {plugin_url}/register` to notify your plugin. This is a **blocking** call — if your plugin returns a non-2xx response, the role link creation is rolled back and the admin sees an error.

**Request from RoleLogic:**

```http
POST {plugin_url}/register
Authorization: Token rl_...
Content-Type: application/json
User-Agent: RoleLogic/1.0
```

```json
{
  "guild_id": "123456789012345678",
  "role_id": "987654321098765432"
}
```

| Field      | Type   | Description               |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------------------- |
| `guild_id` | string | Discord server (guild) ID |
| `role_id`  | string | Discord role ID           |

**Your server should:**
1. Store the token from the `Authorization` header — this is the token you'll use for the User Management API.
2. Record the `guild_id` and `role_id` for this role link.
3. Return a `200` response to confirm the registration.

**Error handling:** If your server returns a non-2xx response or is unreachable, the role link is **not created**. RoleLogic returns a `502 Bad Gateway` error to the admin.

**Timeout:** 5 seconds.

---

### GET /config

RoleLogic calls `GET {plugin_url}/config` to fetch the configuration UI that admins see in the dashboard.

There are two UI modes, discriminated by the `ui_mode` field:

| `ui_mode`  | Behavior |
| ---------- | -------- |
| `"schema"` (default) | Return a JSON schema; RoleLogic renders the form, handles validation and save. |
| `"iframe"` | Return an `embed_url`; RoleLogic renders it in an iframe and the plugin owns the entire save UX. See [Iframe UI Mode](#iframe-ui-mode). |

The rest of this section describes `ui_mode: "schema"`. For iframe-mode plugins, the `sections`/`values` fields are not used, and `POST /config` is never called.

**Request headers from RoleLogic:**

| Header          | Value               |
| --------------- | ------------------- |
| `Authorization` | `Token rl_...`      |
| `Accept`        | `application/json`  |
| `User-Agent`    | `RoleLogic/1.0`     |

**Your server must respond with `200 OK` and a JSON body matching this structure:**

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "name": "My Plugin",
  "description": "Optional description shown in the dashboard",
  "sections": [
    {
      "title": "Section Title",
      "description": "Optional section description",
      "collapsible": false,
      "default_collapsed": false,
      "fields": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "key": "api_key",
          "label": "API Key",
          "description": "Your platform API key",
          "placeholder": "Enter your API key",
          "validation": { "required": true, "max": 200 }
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "values": {
    "api_key": "sk_live_abc123"
  }
}
```

**Constraints:**

| Property   | Limit             |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| `version`  | Must be `1`       |
| `name`     | Max 100 chars     |
| `description` | Max 500 chars  |
| `sections` | 1–10 sections     |
| Fields per section | 1–30 fields |
| Field keys | Unique across all sections, alphanumeric + underscores only (`^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$`), max 100 chars |

**Caching:** RoleLogic caches the schema structure (without `values`) for **5 minutes**. The `values` object is always fetched fresh. Admins can force a cache refresh from the dashboard.

**Timeout:** 5 seconds. Response body capped at 50 KB.

**Fallback behavior:** If your server is unreachable or returns an invalid schema, RoleLogic falls back to the cached schema (if available). Otherwise, it returns a `502 Bad Gateway` error to the dashboard.

---

### POST /config

When an admin saves configuration in the dashboard, RoleLogic validates the data against your schema, then sends it to `POST {plugin_url}/config`.

**Request from RoleLogic:**

```http
POST {plugin_url}/config
Authorization: Token rl_...
Content-Type: application/json
User-Agent: RoleLogic/1.0
```

```json
{
  "guild_id": "123456789012345678",
  "role_id": "987654321098765432",
  "config": {
    "api_key": "sk_live_abc123",
    "sync_interval": 60,
    "enable_notifications": true
  }
}
```

| Field      | Type   | Description                                  |
| ---------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `guild_id` | string | Discord server (guild) ID                    |
| `role_id`  | string | Discord role ID                              |
| `config`   | object | Key-value pairs matching your schema fields. Only non-`display` fields with submitted values are included. |

**Your server should:**
1. Validate and store the configuration.
2. Return a `200` response (the response body is forwarded to the dashboard).
3. Begin using the configuration to manage users via the User Management API.

**After a successful save:** The dashboard automatically refetches your plugin's `GET /config` endpoint to display the latest configuration values. Ensure your response reflects the newly saved config immediately.

**Error handling:** If your server returns a 4xx error, RoleLogic forwards the original status code and error message to the admin. For 5xx errors or network failures, RoleLogic returns a `502 Bad Gateway`. Include a meaningful error message in the response body:

```json
{ "error": "Invalid API key" }
```

or

```json
{ "message": "API key does not have required permissions" }
```

RoleLogic extracts the `error` or `message` field from your response and displays it.

**Timeout:** 10 seconds. Response body capped at 50 KB.

---

### DELETE /config

When an admin deletes a role link, RoleLogic notifies your plugin so you can clean up. This is a **fire-and-forget** call — failures are logged but do not block the deletion.

**Request from RoleLogic:**

```http
DELETE {plugin_url}/config
Authorization: Token rl_...
Content-Type: application/json
User-Agent: RoleLogic/1.0
```

```json
{
  "guild_id": "123456789012345678",
  "role_id": "987654321098765432"
}
```

**Your server should:** Remove any stored configuration and stop managing users for this role link. The API token included in the request will be invalidated after deletion.

**Timeout:** 5 seconds. Failures do not affect the deletion.

---

## Iframe UI Mode

For plugins that need richer configuration UIs than the built-in form schema can express — rule builders, drag-and-drop editors, live previews, multi-step wizards — return `ui_mode: "iframe"` from `GET /config` and RoleLogic will embed your own page in the dashboard. Your plugin owns the entire save UX; there is no "Save" button on RoleLogic's side and no `POST /config` call.

### Response shape

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "ui_mode": "iframe",
  "name": "My Plugin",
  "description": "Optional description shown above the iframe",
  "embed_url": "https://plugin.example.com/configure"
}
```

| Field        | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                  |
| ------------ | ------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `version`    | `1`    | Yes      | Contract version.                                                                            |
| `ui_mode`    | string | Yes      | Must be `"iframe"`.                                                                          |
| `name`       | string | Yes      | Plugin name shown in the dashboard header.                                                   |
| `description`| string | No       | Optional descriptive text rendered above the iframe.                                         |
| `embed_url`  | string | Yes      | HTTPS URL to render inside the iframe. Max 2000 chars. Cannot point to private/internal hosts. |

### Auth handoff (signed token)

RoleLogic does **not** rely on third-party cookies to authenticate the admin to your iframe. Instead, the backend mints a short-lived **JWT** and appends it to your `embed_url` as a query parameter named `rl_token`:

```
https://plugin.example.com/configure?rl_token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

If `embed_url` already contains query parameters, they are preserved.

**Token format**

- Algorithm: **HS256**
- Secret: the plugin's **raw API token** (the `rl_...` value RoleLogic sent to your plugin in the `Authorization` header during [`POST /register`](#post-register)). Store it during registration; verify with it on every iframe request.
- Lifetime: **5 minutes** from issue. The dashboard refetches `GET /config` when the tab regains focus, which mints a fresh token.

**Claims**

| Claim      | Type   | Description                                                  |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `iss`      | string | Always `"rolelogic"`.                                        |
| `aud`      | string | Your `plugin_url` (the base URL RoleLogic calls).            |
| `sub`      | string | Discord user ID of the admin viewing the iframe.             |
| `guild_id` | string | Discord guild ID being configured.                           |
| `role_id`  | string | Discord role ID being configured.                            |
| `iat`      | number | Issued-at timestamp (seconds since epoch).                   |
| `exp`      | number | Expiry timestamp (`iat + 300`).                              |

**Verification (Node.js example)**

```js
import jwt from "jsonwebtoken";

// `roleLinkToken` is the rl_... value you stored during POST /register
const payload = jwt.verify(req.query.rl_token, roleLinkToken, {
  algorithms: ["HS256"],
  issuer: "rolelogic",
  audience: process.env.PUBLIC_PLUGIN_URL,
});
// payload.guild_id, payload.role_id, payload.sub (admin discord_id)
```

**Important:**
- Always verify `aud`, `iss`, `exp`, and the signature. Never trust unverified claims.
- The token is bound to a single role link via its HMAC key. A token signed with one role link's API token cannot be reused for another role link.

### postMessage protocol

Messages flow in both directions. Origins are checked on both sides — the dashboard ignores anything not from `new URL(embed_url).origin`, and your iframe should ignore messages whose `event.origin` isn't the RoleLogic dashboard.

#### Iframe → dashboard

```js
// Auto-resize: tell the dashboard how tall to make the iframe.
window.parent.postMessage({ type: "rl:resize", height: document.body.scrollHeight }, "*");

// Optional: notify the dashboard that a save completed (shows a toast).
window.parent.postMessage({ type: "rl:saved" }, "*");

// Optional: tell the dashboard there are unsaved changes (prompts on close).
window.parent.postMessage({ type: "rl:dirty", dirty: true }, "*");

// Optional: surface an arbitrary toast through the dashboard's notification system.
// Use this for save errors, validation failures, or any other status the admin
// needs to see regardless of where they've scrolled — the iframe auto-resizes
// to content, so it has no internal viewport for an in-iframe toast to anchor to.
window.parent.postMessage({ type: "rl:toast", message: "Save failed.", kind: "error" }, "*");
```

| Message type | Payload                              | Effect on the dashboard                                                                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rl:resize`  | `{ height: number }`                 | Sets iframe height. Clamped to 200–4000 px.                                               |
| `rl:saved`   | —                                    | Shows a success toast. The plugin decides whether to close itself.                        |
| `rl:dirty`   | `{ dirty: boolean }`                 | When `true`, the dashboard prompts before closing.                                        |
| `rl:toast`   | `{ message: string, kind?: string }` | Shows a toast in the dashboard's notification system. `kind` is `"success"` or `"error"` (default). |

#### Dashboard → iframe

```js
window.addEventListener("message", (event) => {
  // In production, also check event.origin against the RoleLogic dashboard origin.
  if (event.data && event.data.type === "rl:visible") {
    refreshFromServer(); // your refresh function — see "Refreshing state" below
  }
});
```

| Message type  | Payload | Sent when                                                                   |
| ------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rl:visible`  | —       | The parent tab becomes visible (admin returned from another tab/window).    |

The dashboard sends `rl:visible` because `visibilitychange` events on iframe documents don't fire reliably across browsers when the *parent tab's* visibility flips. Using this message instead of in-iframe `visibilitychange` is the reliable cross-browser way to detect tab return.

### Refreshing state on tab return

A common scenario: the admin opens your iframe, jumps to another tab (or a `target="_blank"` link in your iframe) to do something related, then comes back. You usually want to pick up external changes — newly created records, renamed items, status updates — *without* discarding any in-progress edits the admin already made in your iframe.

The robust pattern is to split your in-memory state into two buckets and apply different refresh policies to each:

| Bucket          | Examples                                          | Refresh policy on `rl:visible`                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **External data** | Lists of items the user picks from, server-side status, counts, available options | Always refresh. The user didn't author this data; updating it doesn't lose work. |
| **Edit buffer** | The form fields the user is filling in (config values, selections, drafts) | Only refresh when the buffer is clean (no unsaved changes). Otherwise keep the user's in-progress values. |

Track a `dirty` flag locally (you already need it for `rl:dirty` postMessage). Skip the edit-buffer half of the refresh while dirty:

```js
let state = null;     // server data, populated by initial load
let dirty = false;    // true once the user has made unsaved edits
let refreshInFlight = false;

async function refreshFromServer() {
  if (!state || refreshInFlight) return;
  refreshInFlight = true;
  try {
    const data = await fetchYourBackend();

    // External data — always pick up changes.
    if (JSON.stringify(data.externalList) !== JSON.stringify(state.externalList)) {
      state.externalList = data.externalList;
      renderExternalList();
    }

    // Edit buffer — only refresh when nothing to lose.
    if (!dirty &&
        JSON.stringify(data.config) !== JSON.stringify(state.config)) {
      state.config = data.config;
      renderEditBuffer();
    }
  } finally {
    refreshInFlight = false;
  }
}

window.addEventListener("message", (event) => {
  if (event.data && event.data.type === "rl:visible") refreshFromServer();
});
```

Notes:

- **Compare before re-rendering.** Calling `render()` on identical data is wasteful and blows away scroll position, open dropdowns, and focus. A cheap `JSON.stringify` diff prevents the flicker.
- **Debounce concurrent fetches.** `refreshInFlight` prevents pile-ups if multiple events fire close together (`rl:visible` plus the browser's native `focus` event, etc.).
- **Re-check `dirty` after the fetch.** A long-running refresh can return after the user starts editing. Test `dirty` again before mutating the edit buffer.
- **Don't reload the iframe to refresh.** The dashboard captures the `embed_url` on first render and never updates the iframe's `src`, even when it refetches `GET /config` with a new `rl_token`. The intent is for the iframe to manage its own lifecycle via these messages; refreshing your data in-place keeps the user's session intact.

### CSP / frame-ancestors

Your iframe response must allow the RoleLogic dashboard to embed it. Set the `Content-Security-Policy` header on the response that serves `embed_url`:

```
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors https://rolelogic.faizo.net
```

Do **not** send `X-Frame-Options: DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN` — those headers will block embedding.

If you are developing against a dashboard running locally, that is a different
origin and must be listed too — `frame-ancestors` takes origins (scheme, host,
port), so the production host alone will not cover it:

```
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors https://rolelogic.faizo.net http://localhost:5173
```

`http://localhost:5173` is the Vite dev server's default; use whichever origin
your dashboard is actually served from. Serve the permissive header only in
development — shipping a `localhost` entry to production lets any page on the
developer's own machine frame your plugin.

### Sandbox

RoleLogic renders the iframe with the following `sandbox` attribute:

```
sandbox="allow-scripts allow-forms allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"
```

This allows scripts, forms, popup windows, and same-origin treatment (so cookies, localStorage, and your own auth work normally on your domain).

### Minimal iframe plugin example

```js
// GET /config → return iframe mode
app.get("/config", (req, res) => {
  res.json({
    version: 1,
    ui_mode: "iframe",
    name: "Rule Builder",
    embed_url: "https://plugin.example.com/configure",
  });
});

// GET /configure → page rendered inside the dashboard iframe
app.get("/configure", (req, res) => {
  const { rl_token } = req.query;
  let claims;
  try {
    claims = jwt.verify(rl_token, getRoleLinkToken(/* lookup by aud */), {
      algorithms: ["HS256"],
      issuer: "rolelogic",
    });
  } catch {
    res.status(401).send("Invalid token");
    return;
  }

  res.set("Content-Security-Policy", "frame-ancestors https://rolelogic.faizo.net");
  res.send(`<!doctype html>
    <html><body>
      <h1>Configure ${claims.guild_id} / ${claims.role_id}</h1>
      <!-- your UI here; call your own backend to save -->
      <script>
        // Auto-resize once content has rendered.
        const sendHeight = () =>
          parent.postMessage({ type: "rl:resize", height: document.body.scrollHeight }, "*");
        new ResizeObserver(sendHeight).observe(document.body);
        sendHeight();
      </script>
    </body></html>`);
});
```

### Notes

- `POST /config` is **never called** for iframe plugins. If you accidentally accept config submissions there, they will not arrive from RoleLogic. The dashboard will reject the call with `400` if attempted.
- `POST /register`, `DELETE /config`, and `GET /health` work identically to schema-mode plugins.
- Plugins may switch between `ui_mode: "schema"` and `ui_mode: "iframe"` between requests; the dashboard always honors the latest response.

---

## Schema Reference

The schema defines the configuration form rendered in the RoleLogic Dashboard. Each field has a `type` that determines its appearance and validation behavior.

### Field Types

#### `text`

Single-line text input.

```json
{
  "type": "text",
  "key": "webhook_url",
  "label": "Webhook URL",

### Common Field Properties

All field types share these base properties:

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | string | Yes | One of: `text`, `textarea`, `number`, `select`, `radio`, `checkbox`, `toggle`, `secret`, `url`, `color`, `slider`, `multi_select`, `display` |
| `key` | string | Yes | Unique identifier (`^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$`, max 100 chars) |
| `label` | string | Yes | Display label (max 200 chars) |
| `description` | string? | No | Help text below the field (max 500 chars) |
| `condition` | object? | No | Single condition for conditional visibility (see below) |
| `conditions` | array? | No | Multiple conditions — **all** must match for the field to be visible (AND logic, max 5) |
| `pair_with` | string? | No | Key of another field to render inline alongside as a range pair (see [Range Pairs](#range-pairs)) |

### Conditional Fields

Fields can be shown or hidden based on another field's value. Use `condition` for a single check or `conditions` (array) when multiple checks must all pass.

#### Single condition

```json
{
  "type": "text",
  "key": "custom_endpoint",
  "label": "Custom Endpoint URL",
  "condition": {
    "field": "region",
    "equals": "custom"
  }
}
```

#### Multiple conditions (AND logic)

All conditions must match for the field to be visible:

```json
{
  "type": "number",
  "key": "value_end_level",
  "label": "Level (end of range)",
  "conditions": [
    { "field": "stat", "equals": "level" },
    { "field": "operator", "equals": "between" }
  ]
}
```

#### `equals_any` — match one of several values

Use `equals_any` instead of `equals` to show a field when the referenced field matches **any** value in the array:

```json
{
  "type": "select",
  "key": "operator",
  "label": "Comparison",
  "condition": {
    "field": "stat",
    "equals_any": ["level", "score", "rank"]
  }
}
```

#### Condition properties

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `field` | string | The `key` of another field in the schema (max 100 chars) |
| `equals` | string \| number \| boolean | The value that field must have for the condition to pass. Optional if `equals_any` is set |
| `equals_any` | array of string \| number \| boolean | The condition passes if the field's value matches **any** entry in the array. Optional if `equals` is set |

At least one of `equals` or `equals_any` should be provided. All referenced fields must exist in the schema — conditions referencing unknown fields cause a validation error.

### Range Pairs

Two fields can be rendered **side by side** as a range (e.g. `[30] to [55]`) by setting `pair_with` on the end field to the `key` of the start field. This is useful when your plugin supports "between" or range comparisons.

```json
[
  {
    "type": "number",
    "key": "value_level",
    "label": "Adventure Rank",
    "validation": { "required": true, "min": 1, "max": 60 },
    "condition": { "field": "stat", "equals": "level" }
  },
  {
    "type": "number",
    "key": "value_end_level",
    "label": "Adventure Rank (end)",
    "validation": { "required": true, "min": 1, "max": 60 },
    "pair_with": "value_level",
    "conditions": [
      { "field": "stat", "equals": "level" },
      { "field": "operator", "equals": "between" }
    ]
  }
]
```

When both fields are visible, the dashboard renders them as:

> **Adventure Rank** *(1–60)*
> `[30]` **to** `[55]`

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pair_with` | string | The `key` of the start field to pair with. Must reference an existing field in the schema |

The end field's label and description are hidden in the inline layout — only the start field's label is shown. Both fields are still independently validated.

### Collapsible Sections

Sections can be made collapsible so admins can expand/collapse them in the dashboard. Useful for grouping advanced or optional settings.

```json
{
  "title": "Advanced Settings",
  "description": "Optional configuration for power users",
  "collapsible": true,
  "default_collapsed": true,
  "fields": [ ... ]
}
```

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `collapsible` | boolean? | Whether the section can be collapsed/expanded (default: `false`) |
| `default_collapsed` | boolean? | Whether the section starts collapsed (default: `false`). Only honored when `collapsible` is `true` |

### The `values` Object

Include a `values` key in your schema response to pre-populate the form with existing configuration:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "name": "My Plugin",
  "sections": [ ... ],
  "values": {
    "api_key": "sk_live_abc123",
    "sync_interval": 60,
    "enable_logging": true
  }
}
```

Keys in `values` correspond to field `key` properties. RoleLogic always fetches `values` fresh (not cached) so admins see the latest configuration.

---

## User Management API

The User Management API lets your plugin programmatically control which Discord users are linked to a role. When you add or remove users, the RoleLogic bot automatically syncs the corresponding Discord role assignments.

### Base URL

```
https://api-rolelogic.faizo.net
```

### Authentication

Every request must include an `Authorization` header using the **`Token`** scheme (not `Bearer`):

```http
Authorization: Token rl_...
```

Tokens start with the `rl_` prefix and are scoped to exactly **one role link** (one guild + one role combination). A token for one role link cannot access another, even within the same guild.

#### How to Get a Token

- **Plugin developers:** The token is automatically generated when a role link is created and sent to your plugin server in the `Authorization` header during the `POST /register` call. Extract and store it during registration.
- **Dashboard users:** Tokens are not manually visible or resettable. To get a new token, delete the role link and recreate it.

:::warning
Tokens cannot be reset independently. To regenerate a token, you must **delete and recreate** the role link. This will trigger a new `POST /register` call to your plugin with the new token.
:::

### Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type   | Format                      | Description                          |
| --------- | ------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `guildId` | string | Numeric (Discord snowflake) | The Discord server (guild) ID        |
| `roleId`  | string | Numeric (Discord snowflake) | The Discord role ID                  |
| `userId`  | string | 17–20 digit numeric string  | A Discord user ID (snowflake format) |

---

### List Users

Retrieve all Discord user IDs currently linked to this role.

```http
GET /api/role-link/:guildId/:roleId/users
```

**Headers**

| Header          | Value              |
| --------------- | ---------------    |
| `Authorization` | `Token rl_...`     |

**Response `200 OK`**

```json
{
  "data": ["123456789012345678", "234567890123456789"]
}
```

`data` is an array of Discord user ID strings. Returns an empty array `[]` if no users are linked.

---

### Replace Users (Batch Set)

Atomically replaces the entire user list. The old list is fully removed and the new list is inserted in a single transaction. Use this for full synchronization from an external source.

```http
PUT /api/role-link/:guildId/:roleId/users
```

**Headers**

| Header          | Value                |
| --------------- | -------------------- |
| `Authorization` | `Token rl_...`       |
| `Content-Type`  | `application/json`   |

**Request Body**

A JSON array of Discord user ID strings (17–20 digits each):

```json
["123456789012345678", "234567890123456789", "345678901234567890"]
```

- Each ID must be a valid Discord snowflake (17–20 digits).
- Duplicate IDs are automatically deduplicated.
- Maximum **100,000 users per request**. For larger lists, use the [chunked upload flow](#upload-users-chunked).
- Total user count after the call must stay within your plan's limit (see [Limits](#limits)).
- An empty array `[]` removes all users.

**Response `200 OK`**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user_count": 3
  }
}
```

`user_count` reflects the number of **unique** users stored after deduplication.

**Timeout:** This endpoint has a **2-minute timeout**. If you hit the 100,000-user cap with a `413` or want to upload lists that don't fit in a single request, use the [chunked upload flow](#upload-users-chunked).

---

### Upload Users (Chunked)

For user lists larger than **100,000**, use the chunked upload flow. The server accumulates user IDs in a staging area across multiple short HTTP requests, then atomically swaps the live list on commit. This avoids the memory, request-size, and transaction-timeout limits of a single `PUT` for very large lists (up to the per-role-link plan limit — see [Limits](#limits)).

The flow has three mandatory steps plus an optional cancel:

1. **`POST /users/upload`** — start a session, get an `upload_id`.
2. **`POST /users/upload/:uploadId/chunk`** — append one or more batches of user IDs (≤ 100,000 per request). Repeat as many times as needed.
3. **`POST /users/upload/:uploadId/commit`** — atomically replace the live list with the accumulated users.
4. **`DELETE /users/upload/:uploadId`** *(optional)* — discard an in-progress session.

**Sessions expire after 24 hours** if not committed or cancelled; uncommitted staging data is garbage-collected automatically.

#### 1. Start an upload session

```http
POST /api/role-link/:guildId/:roleId/users/upload
```

**Headers**

| Header          | Value          |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| `Authorization` | `Token rl_...` |

**Request body:** none (empty body).

**Response `200 OK`**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "upload_id": "3f2a1b7c-8e4d-4f5a-9b0c-1d2e3f4a5b6c"
  }
}
```

The `upload_id` is a UUID scoped to this role link. It is required for all subsequent chunk, commit, and cancel requests in the session.

---

#### 2. Append a chunk

```http
POST /api/role-link/:guildId/:roleId/users/upload/:uploadId/chunk
```

**Headers**

| Header          | Value              |
| --------------- | ------------------ |
| `Authorization` | `Token rl_...`     |
| `Content-Type`  | `application/json` |

**Request body** — a JSON array of Discord user ID strings (17–20 digits each):

```json
["111222333444555666", "222333444555666777", "..."]
```

- Up to **100,000 user IDs per chunk**.
- Duplicates across chunks are automatically deduplicated at commit time.
- Chunks can be sent **sequentially or in parallel** (up to a reasonable concurrency — e.g. 4 in flight). Each chunk is an independent short transaction.

**Response `200 OK`**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "chunks": 3,
    "users": 287145
  }
}
```

| Field    | Description                                                            |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `chunks` | Total number of chunks accepted into this session so far               |
| `users`  | Total number of user IDs staged so far (across all chunks, before dedup) |

The plan's per-role-link limit is **not** enforced on individual chunks — only at commit time. This lets you stage a large list and find out on commit whether it fits within your plan.

---

#### 3. Commit the upload

```http
POST /api/role-link/:guildId/:roleId/users/upload/:uploadId/commit
```

Atomically replaces the entire live user list with the users staged in this session. The old list is deleted and the staged users are inserted in a single transaction, then the session's staging data is cleaned up.

**Headers**

| Header          | Value          |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| `Authorization` | `Token rl_...` |

**Request body:** none.

**Response `200 OK`**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user_count": 287145
  }
}
```

`user_count` is the number of unique users now linked to the role after the swap.

**Behavior:**

- If the staged user count exceeds your plan's limit, the commit is rejected with a `400` error and the staging data is preserved so you can inspect or cancel it.
- After a successful commit, the bot is notified to sync role assignments on Discord. For very large lists, the initial bulk application to Discord is rate-limited by Discord itself and can take **days** for multi-million-user role links (see [Role Sync Behavior](#role-sync-behavior)).
- Committing a session with **zero chunks** is allowed and results in an empty user list (equivalent to `PUT /users` with `[]`).

**Timeout:** Up to **30 minutes** for the atomic swap on very large lists. Typical commits for &lt; 1M users finish in seconds.

---

#### Cancel an upload

```http
DELETE /api/role-link/:guildId/:roleId/users/upload/:uploadId
```

Discards an uncommitted session and its staged users. The live user list is not touched.

**Headers**

| Header          | Value          |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| `Authorization` | `Token rl_...` |

**Response `200 OK`**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "cancelled": true
  }
}
```

Calling cancel on an unknown, already-committed, or already-cancelled `upload_id` returns a `404` error.

---

### Check User

Check whether a specific Discord user exists in the linked user list.

```http
GET /api/role-link/:guildId/:roleId/users/:userId
```

**Headers**

| Header          | Value          |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| `Authorization` | `Token rl_...` |

**Response `200 OK`**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "exists": true
  }
}
```

| Value           | Meaning                                 |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `exists: true`  | The user is in the linked user list     |
| `exists: false` | The user is not in the linked user list |

---

### Add User

Add a single Discord user to the linked user list. This operation is **idempotent** — calling it for a user who already exists succeeds without error and returns `added: false`.

```http
POST /api/role-link/:guildId/:roleId/users/:userId
```

**Headers**

| Header          | Value          |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| `Authorization` | `Token rl_...` |

**Response `200 OK`**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "added": true
  }
}
```

| Value          | Meaning                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `added: true`  | User was newly added to the list      |
| `added: false` | User already existed — no change made |

---

### Remove User

Remove a single Discord user from the linked user list. This operation is **idempotent** — calling it for a user who doesn't exist succeeds without error and returns `removed: false`.

```http
DELETE /api/role-link/:guildId/:roleId/users/:userId
```

**Headers**

| Header          | Value          |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| `Authorization` | `Token rl_...` |

**Response `200 OK`**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "removed": true
  }
}
```

| Value            | Meaning                                   |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `removed: true`  | User was removed from the list            |
| `removed: false` | User was not in the list — no change made |

---

### Role Sync Behavior

When you modify the user list (Add, Remove, or Replace), RoleLogic automatically notifies the bot to sync role assignments on Discord. Changes typically apply within seconds, provided the user count is within the allowed limit.

If the stored user count exceeds the plan's **sync limit** (e.g., after a plan downgrade), the link keeps working: the bot syncs the lowest `sync limit` user IDs and **holds** the rest. Held users are stored, not discarded — they are simply not assigned the role yet, and they activate automatically the moment the server upgrades, with no re-upload. Which users are held is decided by user ID order, so the synced set stays the same between syncs rather than rotating.

If the server has **more role links than its plan's integration slots** (e.g., after a plan downgrade), the newest links beyond the allowance are **paused**: the dashboard shows "Integration paused", the bot stops syncing them, and every User Management API call for them returns a `403` error until the server upgrades or deletes other role links. Pausing is fully reversible — the stored user list is kept, and syncing resumes automatically once the link is back within the slot allowance.

## Limits

| Resource                              | Free Plan | Premium    |
| ------------------------------------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Users **synced** per role link        | 100       | 30,000,000 |
| Users **stored** per role link        | 10,000    | 30,000,000 |
| Role links per server                 | 2         | Up to 210  |
| Users per single `PUT /users` request | 10,000    | 100,000    |
| Users per chunk in a chunked upload   | —         | 100,000    |
| Chunked upload session TTL            | —         | 24 hours   |

- **Synced vs. stored.** On the free plan these differ deliberately. Writes are accepted up to the *stored* limit, and the lowest 100 user IDs are the ones actually given the role; the remainder are held (see [Role Sync Behavior](#role-sync-behavior)). Keep sending your full qualifying set — the overflow activates on upgrade without another upload. On premium the two limits are identical, so nothing is ever held.
- `GET /users` reports the split as `synced_count` and `pending_count`, alongside `synced_limit` (what is acted on) and `user_limit` (what a write may contain).
- Exceeding the **stored** limit on **Add User**, **Replace Users**, or **Commit Upload** returns a `400` error with a message indicating the maximum allowed. Exceeding only the *sync* limit is not an error.
- Role links beyond the server's slot count (e.g. after a downgrade) are **paused**: the bot stops syncing them and all User Management API calls for them return a `403` error (see [Role Sync Behavior](#role-sync-behavior)).
- The error message includes a hint to upgrade if on the free plan.
- Use the [chunked upload flow](#upload-users-chunked) for any list larger than 100,000 users — a single `PUT /users` with more than 100,000 IDs is rejected.
- For multi-million-user role links, the initial bulk application to Discord is rate-limited by Discord and can take **days** to complete. Steady-state incremental changes (adds/removes) apply within seconds.
- Upgrade to a premium plan for higher user limits. See [Plans & Pricing](../plans).

## Examples

### Minimal Plugin Server (Node.js / Express)

A minimal plugin server that manages a "VIP" role based on a configured API key:

```javascript
import express from "express";

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

// Store config per guild+role (use a database in production)
const configs = new Map();
const tokens = new Map();

// POST /register — Acknowledge role link creation and store the token

GID=123456789
RID=987654321
H="Authorization: Token $TOKEN"
CT="Content-Type: application/json"

# 1. Start a session
UPLOAD=$(curl -s -X POST -H "$H" "$API/api/role-link/$GID/$RID/users/upload" \
  | jq -r .data.upload_id)

# 2. Append chunks (repeat for each batch of up to 100,000 user IDs)
curl -X POST -H "$H" -H "$CT" \
  -d @chunk_1.json \
  "$API/api/role-link/$GID/$RID/users/upload/$UPLOAD/chunk"

curl -X POST -H "$H" -H "$CT" \
  -d @chunk_2.json \
  "$API/api/role-link/$GID/$RID/users/upload/$UPLOAD/chunk"

# 3. Commit — atomically swaps the live user list
curl -X POST -H "$H" "$API/api/role-link/$GID/$RID/users/upload/$UPLOAD/commit"

# Or cancel to discard an in-progress session
# curl -X DELETE -H "$H" "$API/api/role-link/$GID/$RID/users/upload/$UPLOAD"
```

## Best Practices

### Plugin Server

- **Always return `values` in your schema** so admins see their current configuration when revisiting the form. Only the schema structure is cached; values are fetched fresh every time.
- **Keep your `GET /config` endpoint fast** (under 5 seconds). If fetching current values is slow, consider caching them on your side.
- **Validate the `Authorization` header** on incoming requests from RoleLogic to ensure they're legitimate. You can verify the token by making a test call to the User Management API.
- **Handle `DELETE /config` gracefully.** The token will be invalidated after the role link is deleted, so clean up any stored state and stop sync jobs.
- **Return descriptive errors from `POST /config`.** Include an `error` or `message` field in your response body — RoleLogic displays it to the admin.
- **Use HTTPS** for your plugin URL. HTTP is rejected.

### User Management

- **Prefer `PUT` (Replace Users) for periodic full syncs of up to 100,000 users.** It's atomic and handles additions and removals in one call.
- **Use the [chunked upload flow](#upload-users-chunked) for lists larger than 100,000.** Start a session, stream chunks (≤ 100,000 IDs each, optionally in parallel), then commit. The commit does an atomic swap — there's no window where the list is partially applied.
- **Use `POST`/`DELETE` (Add/Remove User) for real-time, event-driven updates** — e.g., when a user completes a purchase. For very large role links, always prefer these over re-uploading the full list.
- **All write endpoints are idempotent.** Adding an existing user or removing a non-existent user succeeds without error. Safe to retry on network failures.
- **Cancel stale upload sessions** with `DELETE /users/upload/:uploadId` if you abort mid-upload. Sessions also auto-expire after 24 hours, but cancelling frees staging storage immediately.
- **Check your user count against limits** before calling Replace Users or Commit Upload to avoid `400` errors.
- **Use the `Token` scheme, not `Bearer`.** Using `Bearer` returns `401`.
- **Store the token securely.** Tokens start with `rl_` and should be treated as secrets.

## FAQ

### What is the Role Link API used for?

The Role Link API allows external applications (plugins) to programmatically manage which Discord users are linked to a specific role through RoleLogic. Common use cases include: granting roles after a purchase or subscription, syncing role membership from an external database, automating verification flows, and integrating with third-party platforms.

### What does a plugin need to implement?

At minimum, three HTTP endpoints: `POST /register` (acknowledges role link creation and receives the API token), `GET /config` (returns the configuration form), and `POST /config` (receives submitted configuration). Optionally, `DELETE /config` for cleanup on role link deletion. Your plugin then calls the User Management API to add/remove users.

### How does RoleLogic authenticate to my plugin?

RoleLogic sends the role link's API token in the `Authorization: Token rl_...` header on all requests to your plugin server. You can verify this token by making a test call to the User Management API.

### How do I get the API token in my plugin?

RoleLogic includes the token in the `Authorization` header when it calls your plugin's `/register` and `/config` (GET, POST, DELETE) endpoints. The best place to extract and store the token is during the `POST /register` call, which is the first request your plugin receives when a role link is created.

### What is the difference between Token and Bearer authentication?

The User Management API uses the `Token` scheme (`Authorization: Token rl_...`), **not** `Bearer`. Using `Bearer` returns a `401` error. This distinguishes external API tokens from internal service authentication.

### Can one token access multiple role links?

No. Each token is scoped to exactly one role link (one guild + one role). To manage multiple role links, each will have its own token.

### How do I get a new token?

Tokens cannot be reset independently. To get a new token, delete the role link and recreate it. The new token will be sent to your plugin during the `POST /register` call.

### Are the Add and Remove endpoints idempotent?

Yes. Adding a user who already exists returns `added: false` (no error). Removing a user who doesn't exist returns `removed: false` (no error). This makes it safe to retry requests.

### What is the user limit?

Free plan: 100 users **synced** per role link, out of up to 10,000 stored. Premium: up to 30,000,000, synced and stored. The limit applies per individual role link, not per server. The number of role links shares the server's integration quota: 2 free plus any paid slots assigned to that server.

### What happens if the user count exceeds the limit?

Nothing breaks. Past the **sync** limit the link keeps running — the lowest 100 user IDs get the role and the rest are held until the server upgrades, at which point they activate on their own. Only the **stored** limit rejects a write, with a `400` error on **Add User**, **Replace Users**, or **Commit Upload**.

This is a change from earlier releases, where a single user over the limit stopped the link syncing altogether.

### How do I upload more than 100,000 users at once?

Use the [chunked upload flow](#upload-users-chunked): start a session with `POST /users/upload`, append chunks of up to 100,000 IDs with `POST /users/upload/:uploadId/chunk`, then atomically swap the live list with `POST /users/upload/:uploadId/commit`. A single `PUT /users` request is capped at 100,000 IDs.

### How long do chunked upload sessions last?

Sessions expire **24 hours** after creation if not committed or cancelled. Expired sessions and their staged users are garbage-collected automatically. You can cancel a session early with `DELETE /users/upload/:uploadId` to free staging storage immediately.

### How quickly do role changes take effect on Discord?

Small changes typically apply within seconds after a User Management API call. RoleLogic notifies the bot immediately, and the bot processes the sync. Delays may occur during high-traffic periods or if the bot is rate-limited by Discord. For the **initial bulk apply** of a multi-million-user role link, Discord's own API rate limits mean the full rollout can take **days**, even though the user list itself was stored in minutes — steady-state incremental changes after that apply within seconds.

### What happens if my plugin server is down?

If the `GET /config` endpoint is unreachable, RoleLogic falls back to a cached schema (if available) for up to 5 minutes. If no cache exists, the dashboard shows a `502` error. The User Management API is unaffected by plugin server outages — it's hosted by RoleLogic.
