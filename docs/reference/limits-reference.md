# Limits Reference

This page documents all limits and constraints in RoleLogic. Understanding these helps you plan your automation effectively and avoid unexpected issues.

## Quick Reference

Here's a summary of the most important limits:

| Category                  | Limit        | Value                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------- |
| Rules per server (free)   | Default      | 2 rules                |
| Integrations per server (free) | Default  | 2 integrations         |
| Users per role link (free) | Default     | 100 users              |
| Conditions per rule       | Maximum      | 10 (1 primary + 9 AND) |
| Actions per rule          | Maximum      | 2 (add + remove)       |
| Roles per action          | Maximum      | 250 roles              |
| Roles per condition       | Maximum      | 250 roles              |
| Cross-server sync (free)  | Default      | 2 destination servers  |
| Cross-server sync (premium) | Default    | 10 destination servers |
| Cascade passes            | Safety limit | 100 passes             |

---

## Rule Limits

### Conditions Per Rule

| Limit                         | Value        |
| ----------------------------- | ------------ |
| Primary condition             | 1 (required) |
| Additional AND conditions     | Up to 9      |
| **Total conditions per rule** | **Up to 10** |

You can combine up to 10 conditions with AND logic in a single rule. This allows for precise targeting of specific member role combinations.

---

### Actions Per Rule

| Limit                           | Value        |
| ------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Primary action                  | 1 (required) |
| Additional combined actions     | Up to 1      |
| **Total action types per rule** | **Up to 2**  |

You can have one "Add Roles" action and one "Remove Roles" action in the same rule using the "Add Combined Action" feature.

---

### Roles Per Condition/Action

| Limit               | Value     |
| ------------------- | --------- |
| Roles per condition | Up to 250 |
| Roles per action    | Up to 250 |

You can select up to 250 roles in each condition or action. This is more than enough for virtually any server setup.

---

## Processing Limits

### Rule Evaluation Passes

| Limit                     | Value |
| ------------------------- | ----- |
| Maximum evaluation passes | 100   |

When rules cascade (one rule triggers another), RoleLogic continues processing until:

1. No more rules match, OR
2. 100 passes have been completed

This prevents infinite loops from misconfigured rules. If your rules require more than 100 passes, consider simplifying your rule structure.

---

### Processing Timing

| Process                      | Timing                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Event-driven processing      | Triggered automatically by role changes    |
| Debounce delay               | Free: ~5 sec · Premium: ~1.5 sec            |
| Scheduled sync interval      | Free: ~every 10 min · Premium: ~every 2 min |
| Rule activation after update | Within 1 hour                               |

**What these mean:**

- **Event-driven processing**: When a member's roles change, RoleLogic queues the member for evaluation automatically.
- **Debounce delay**: Multiple rapid role changes are batched for about 5 seconds on Free and 1.5 seconds on Premium to avoid redundant work.
- **Scheduled sync**: A background safety sweep re-checks the whole server to catch any changes missed in real time (e.g. during a restart or Discord outage). On **free** it runs about every 10 minutes; on **premium** about every 2 minutes, and each premium pass scans far more members per cycle. For large servers this means premium fully reconciles dramatically faster — a 100,000-member server catches up in roughly 10 minutes on premium versus a few hours on free. Both plans stay safely within Discord's rate limits.
- **Rule activation**: New or updated rules are fully active within 1 hour of saving

## Quota Limits

Quotas determine how many rules and integrations you can use per server. The same quota allocation increases both limits.

### Free Plan

| Resource                | Limit                               |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Rules per server        | 2 rules                             |
| Integrations per server | 2 integrations                      |
| Users per role link     | 100 users per individual link       |
| Cross-server sync       | Up to 2 destination servers         |
| Webhook watermark       | Included (shows RoleLogic branding) |
| All condition types     | ✅ Full access                      |

The free plan includes everything you need to get started. It's perfect for:

- Small servers testing RoleLogic
- Simple automation setups (verification, basic rewards)
- Servers with straightforward role hierarchies

### Premium Plans

Premium plans expand your capacity. The same quota applies to both rules and integrations:

| Resource             | Premium Benefit                                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Rules per server     | +10 to +208 additional rules (varies by tier)                |
| Integrations per server | +10 to +208 additional integrations (same quota as rules) |
| Users per role link  | Up to 30 million per link (vs. 100 on free)                  |
| Cross-server sync    | Up to 10 destination servers per server (vs. 2 on free)      |
| Webhook watermark    | Removed for clean notifications                              |
| Priority support     | Faster response times                                        |

**Premium tiers (total rules and integrations per server):**

- Tier 1: 12 rules + 12 integrations
- Tier 2: 38 rules + 38 integrations
- Tier 3: 76 rules + 76 integrations
- Tier 4: 132 rules + 132 integrations
- Tier 5: 210 rules + 210 integrations

Check the Upgrade page in your dashboard for current pricing and options.

### Quota Allocation and Cooldowns

| Behavior              | Detail                           |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Quota assignment      | Per-server allocation            |
| Reassignment cooldown | 7 days                           |
| Unused quota          | Can be reassigned after cooldown |

**About the cooldown:**
After assigning premium quota to a server, you must wait 7 days before reassigning it to a different server. This prevents abuse and ensures service stability.

---

## Webhook Limits

### Message Content

| Limit             | Value                             |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Message length    | ~2,000 characters (Discord limit) |
| Embed description | ~4,096 characters (Discord limit) |
| Total embed size  | ~6,000 characters (Discord limit) |

### Webhook Delivery

Webhooks are subject to Discord's rate limits:

- High-frequency events may experience slight delays
- Messages are queued and sent in order
- Delivery can be delayed or fail during Discord/API outages; check the configured channel and logs before retrying

---

## Server and Member Limits

### Servers Per Account

RoleLogic does not add a separate account-wide server cap, but Discord account
and installation limits still apply:

- Each server's rules consume quota separately
- Premium quota must be allocated to specific servers
- Every eligible server retains its free base quota

### Members Per Server

For large servers:

- Initial sync may take longer when first setting up
- Individual changes use the event-driven path and the tier-specific debounce
- Batch operations (like rule changes affecting many members) are processed efficiently
- **Premium significantly shortens full-server reconcile time** — large servers are swept more frequently and with more members per pass, so a full catch-up that takes a few hours on free completes in minutes on premium

---

## Technical Constraints

### Role Hierarchy

| Constraint       | Detail                            |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Manageable roles | Only roles below RoleLogic's role |
| Bot's own role   | Cannot be modified by RoleLogic   |
| Roles above bot  | Cannot be assigned or removed     |

This is a Discord security constraint, not a RoleLogic limitation. [Learn how to configure role hierarchy →](../concepts/role-hierarchy)

### Cross-Server Requirements

| Requirement         | Detail                                              |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Bot presence        | RoleLogic must be in all involved servers           |
| Member presence     | Member must exist in both source and target servers |
| Permissions         | "Manage Roles" required in each server              |
| Linked server limit | 2 destination servers (free) / 10 (premium)         |

#### Cross-Server Sync Limit

The cross-server sync limit counts the **distinct destination servers** referenced by your enabled rules' action roles, not the number of rules or roles. One rule that touches 3 other servers consumes 3 of your slots; ten rules that all target the same server consume just 1.

| Tier                 | Distinct destination servers per server |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Free                 | 2                                      |
| Premium (any tier)   | 10                                     |

**When you try to save a rule that would push your server over the limit**, the API rejects the save with a clear message naming the limit and (if you're free) the premium ceiling. Existing rules are not modified.

**When you downgrade from premium to free**, no rules are deleted. RoleLogic walks your enabled rules in priority order and keeps the highest-priority ones whose destinations fit within the new limit; the rest are automatically paused alongside any over-quota rules. The dashboard shows them with a yellow "rule paused" banner explaining that the cross-server sync limit was exceeded. Editing or deleting the paused rules — or re-subscribing — restores them.

### @everyone Role

| Constraint     | Detail                                 |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Presence       | Every member has @everyone             |
| Removability   | Cannot be removed (Discord constraint) |
| Testing impact | Always include in sandbox tests        |

---

## Safety Limits

RoleLogic includes automatic safety features to prevent runaway automation.

### Reverted Action Detection

If RoleLogic detects that its changes are being repeatedly undone (usually indicating a conflict with another bot or manual intervention), it will automatically stop the rule.

| Parameter        | Value                      |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| Detection window | 1 hour                     |
| Action threshold | 100 reverted actions       |
| Result           | Rule automatically stopped |

**When this triggers:**

- The rule status changes to "Stopped"
- No further processing occurs for that rule
- You'll see a notification in your dashboard
- The Activity Log records the event

**To resolve:**

1. Identify what's conflicting (another bot, manual changes, etc.)
2. Fix the underlying conflict
3. Re-enable the rule from the dashboard

### Cascade Limit

| Limit          | Value                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Maximum passes | 100                    |
| Purpose        | Prevent infinite loops |

If rules trigger each other in a chain, processing stops after 100 passes. This protects your server from accidental infinite loops.

## Activity Log Limits

| Limit                 | Value                                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Log entries displayed | 50 entries per page                        |
| Log retention         | Indefinite (kept as long as server exists) |

## Planning Around Limits

### Optimizing Rule Count

Consolidate where possible to maximize your quota:

**Instead of 3 separate rules:**

```
Rule 1: If Booster → add VIP
Rule 2: If Premium → add VIP
Rule 3: If Supporter → add VIP
```

**Use 1 combined rule:**

```
Rule 1: If has some of [Booster, Premium, Supporter] → add VIP
```

More tips:

- Use "Has Some Roles" with multiple roles instead of multiple rules
- Use threshold conditions ("At Least N") to consolidate counting logic
- Let rules cascade for complex multi-step automation

### Managing Quota

- Delete unused or test rules promptly
- Review rules periodically and remove obsolete ones
- Consider upgrading if consistently at capacity
- Use the 7-day cooldown wisely when reallocating quota

### Handling Large Servers

For servers with many members:

- Initial rule setup may take time to process all members
- Real-time processing remains fast for individual changes
- Test rules thoroughly before enabling on high-population roles
- Consider rule priority to optimize processing order

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What happens when I hit the rule or integration limit?

You cannot create new rules or integrations until you free up quota. Options:

- Delete unused rules or integrations to make room
- Consolidate similar rules into one
- Upgrade to a premium plan for more quota

Existing rules and integrations continue working normally. Items beyond the quota are paused but not deleted.

### Can I request higher limits?

Premium plans offer expanded quotas for most users. For enterprise needs beyond the highest premium tier, contact support about custom plans.

### Why is there a 7-day cooldown on quota reassignment?

The cooldown prevents abuse and ensures service stability. It encourages thoughtful allocation rather than constant switching between servers.

### Are these limits permanent?

Limits may be adjusted over time as the service evolves. The dashboard always shows current limits, which supersede this documentation if different.
