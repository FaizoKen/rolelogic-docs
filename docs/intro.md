# What is RoleLogic?

**TL;DR:** RoleLogic is a free Discord bot that automates role management using IF-THEN rules. Free plan: 2 rules/server, all features. Premium: up to 210 rules. No coding required.

---

RoleLogic is a Discord bot that **automatically manages roles** for your server members. You create simple rules, and RoleLogic handles role assignments 24/7.

## How It Works

RoleLogic uses **IF-THEN rules** to automate role changes:

- **IF** a member has certain roles...
- **THEN** automatically add or remove other roles

**Example:** _"If someone has the Server Booster role, give them VIP."_

That's it. No coding, no complex setup—just simple rules that run automatically.

## Quick Example

**Problem:** You want to remove the "Unverified" role when someone gets verified.

**Without RoleLogic:**

- Manually check for newly verified members
- Remember to remove their old role
- Repeat forever...

**With RoleLogic:**

- Create one rule: "If has Verified → remove Unverified"
- Done. RoleLogic handles it automatically.
