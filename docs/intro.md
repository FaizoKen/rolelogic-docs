**TL;DR:** RoleLogic is a free Discord bot that adds or removes roles based on the roles a member already has. Build no-code IF-THEN rules, test them safely, and keep them running automatically. The free plan includes 3 rules per server; paid plans support up to 211.

RoleLogic is a Discord bot that **automatically manages roles** for your server members. You create simple rules, and RoleLogic handles role assignments 24/7.

## How It Works

RoleLogic uses **IF-THEN rules** to automate role changes:

- **IF** a member has certain roles...
- **THEN** automatically add or remove other roles

**Example:** _"If someone has the Server Booster role, give them VIP."_

That's it. No coding, no complex setup—just simple rules that run automatically.

For a focused walkthrough, see [how to give a Discord role based on another
role](https://rolelogic.faizo.net/discord-conditional-roles).

## Quick Example

**Problem:** You want to remove the "Unverified" role when someone gets verified.

**Without RoleLogic:**

- Manually check for newly verified members
- Remember to remove their old role
- Repeat forever...

**With RoleLogic:**

- Create one rule: "If has Verified → remove Unverified"
- Done. RoleLogic handles it automatically.
